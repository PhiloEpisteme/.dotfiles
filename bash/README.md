# bash dotfiles
This repo contains basic configuration for a BASH environment. If available,
enables tab completion for git commands, sets the prompt and defines some basic
path options.


## Installation
To install this package, clone the repo to `~/.dotfiles` and then symlink the
following files.

    $ git clone https://github.com/PhiloEpisteme/.dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    # Backup your old settings. 
    $ cp ~/.bash_profile ~/.bash_profile_old 
    $ cp ~/.bashrc ~/.bashrc_old
    $ ln -s /path/to/.dotfiles/bash/.bash_profile ~/.bash_profile
    $ ln -s /path/to/.dotfiles/bash/.bashrc ~/.bashrc
    $ source ~/.bash_profile
    # Close all terminal windows or type `source ~/.bash_profile` in each.


## Local Changes
In order to make local modifications simply add your local version to 
`~/.dotfiles/bash/local/<name>rc` and then source `~/.bashrc`.

These changes are sourced after both .bash_profile and .bashrc and so they will
override any settings.

If you have local settings in your profile and/or rc files, you can keep them by
moving them into `~/.dotfiles/bash/local` and ensure they end in rc.
